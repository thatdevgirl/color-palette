## Description

This WordPress plugin adds a color palette block to the post editor, to be used for branding and style guide pages.

### Deprecation coming

The previous version of this plugin added primary and secondary color palettes via a series of shortcodes.  This version is still supported and palettes can be set up in the WordPress admin under Settings > Color Palette and then added to posts via short codes:

* `[primarycolors]`: This shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's primary colors.
* `[accentcolors]`: This shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's accent colors.  These can be colors that compliment your primary colors, for example.

This functionality will be deprecated in a future version.
