# WordPress Color Palette

This WordPress plugin adds a color palette block to the post editor, to be used for branding and style guide pages.

## New post editor blocks!

You can now take advantage of the new ("Gutenberg") post editor by creating color palettes on the fly using the new "Color Palette" block. The "Color Palette" block starts with 4 "Color" blocks, but you can add additional blocks or remove excess blocks as needed. Give each color block a color using the selector in the Inspector Panel on the right-hand side of the editor and give your color a name. Done!

If you need to use the same color palette on multiple pages or posts, simply save the "Color Palette" block with all of your colors as a reusable block through the editor.

## Deprecation coming

The previous version of this plugin added primary and secondary color palettes via a series of shortcodes.  This version is still supported and palettes can be set up in the WordPress admin under Settings > Color Palette and then added to posts via short codes:

* `[primarycolors]`: This shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's primary colors.
* `[accentcolors]`: This shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's accent colors.  These can be colors that compliment your primary colors, for example.

This functionality will be deprecated in a future version.
