Add a Color Palette block to pages in the post editor.

== Description ==

The "Color Palette" block displays a group of colors on your page. The block starts with 3 individual "Color" blocks, but you can add additional blocks or remove excess blocks as needed.

Give each color block a color using the selector in the Inspector Panel on the right-hand side of the editor, give your color a name, and you're done!

If you need to use the same color palette on multiple pages or posts, simply save the "Color Palette" block with all of your colors as a reusable block through the editor.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit any page or post and look for the 'Color Palette' block in the block library.
4. The 'Color Palette' block starts with 3 'Color' blocks, but you can add additional blocks or remove excess blocks as needed.
5. Choose a color for each 'Color' block using the color selector in the Inspector Panel on the right-hand side of the editor and give your color a name.
6. Choose a 'Color block style' in the 'Color Palette' block to determine how you want the colors inside the palette to display.
6. Save the page... and you're done!
