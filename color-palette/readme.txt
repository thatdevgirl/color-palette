This WordPress plugin adds color palettes to your branding and style guide pages via a series of shortcodes.  You can set up your color palettes in the WordPress admin under Settings > Color Palette and then add the shortcodes for each palette to your site's pages.

The **[primarycolors]** shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's primary colors.

The **[accentcolors]** shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's accent colors.  These can be colors that compliment your primary colors, for example.
