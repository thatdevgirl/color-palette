This WordPress plugin adds color palettes to your branding and style guide pages.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin adds color palettes to your branding and style guide pages via a series of shortcodes.  You can set up your color palettes in the WordPress admin under Settings > Color Palette and then add the shortcodes for each palette to your site's pages.

The **[primarycolors]** shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's primary colors.

The **[accentcolors]** shortcode adds a block that will display all of your brand's accent colors.  These can be colors that compliment your primary colors, for example.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation and activate it.

== Screenshots ==

1. Example screenshot of the admin screen, where a content creator can set up the site's primary and accent palettes.  The admin screen can be found in Settings > Color Palette.

2. Example screenshot of a page containing the [primarycolors] and [accentcolors] shortcodes.
